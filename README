...they will be overwritten without being checked for existence.  One
should not use these filenames because they are used by Mercenary.

d3minst is a Perl script that will extract the necessary files to play
Descent 3: Mercenary from the d3merc.pkg file on the expansion's CD.

Included is the Perl module GKPOPackage which parses and extracts files
from the PKG file.

To build d3minst:
	- Run build.pl.  This appends the necessary files to d3minst.  Note
	  that d3minst will be overwritten every time this happens.
	  
To run d3minst:
	- perl d3minst --install=install-dir [optional path to d3merc.pkg]
	- This will use the default path /media/D3_MERCS/d3merg.pkg unless
	  you provide another path to use.
	- An installation directory must be provided, otherwise the script
	  will do nothing.
